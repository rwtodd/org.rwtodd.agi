# AGI-Tools

This is a set of clojure tools for exploring Sierra AGI
adventure game resources.

*Update 2021-10-19*: Since I wrote the original clojure code, I have
since written more comprehensive resource extractors in Go and java
(both in other branches of this repo), and also one in C# (in another
private repo).  **Now,** I am going to rewrite the clojure code and
hopefully make the ultimate version.

I've tagged the last commit of the old clojure version with the tag
`old-clojure` to make the old files easier to find.
